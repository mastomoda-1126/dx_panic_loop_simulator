# dx_panic_loop_simulator

This is a satirical simulation of a "DX project" where:

- The DX side has no clear data model, no roadmap, and lives in constant confusion.
- The frontline side (teachers / staff / operators) also panics because nothing is stable.
- Every attempt at "digital transformation" eventually falls back to: **"Just print it."**

All characters and situations are fictional and generalized.  
Any resemblance to real organizations or persons is purely coincidental.

The goal is to visualize **bad DX patterns**:

- No clear ownership
- No data pipeline design
- Blaming "non-digital-native users" instead of fixing the system
- Paper as the final fallback for everything

Run the simulation and watch the panic loop.

## What this code is actually saying

If your DX project has:

- no data model,
- no clear ownership,
- no roadmap,
- and no one willing to say "stop",

then you are probably already running `run_infinite()` in real life.
